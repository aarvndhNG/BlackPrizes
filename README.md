# Average's Vote Rewards
Support me & this plugin's (along with several others) development on Ko.Fi: Here!

A super simple and lightweight tShock V5 plugin. Allows the user to execute /vote, which checks if the player has voted or not. If the player has voted, they are given rewards. And yes, don't worry, there is a check to make sure the reward can't be claimed more than once per 24 hours!

Permission node for /vote: av.vote
